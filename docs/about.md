Quokka is a cute marsupial about a size of a domestic cat. Like other marsupials, the quokka is herbivorous and mainly nocturnal.

Quokkas ar found on some smaller islands off the coast of Westerna Australia, particularly Rottnest Island. A small colony exists at the eastern limit of their range in a protected area of Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve, where they co-exist with the critically endangered Gilbert's potoroo.

Quokkas have a reputation of being the happiest animal on Earth and they have little fear of humans and commonly approach people closely, particularly on Rottnest Island, where a prevalent population exists.
