Access our website to see more details: http://quokkaproject.org/ Quokka is an open source project and it is available at https://github.com/quokkaproject/quokka . What is Quokka CMS, the happiest CMS in the world? Quokka CMS is a Content Management System, a platform to publish blogs, websites, portals and also a nice solution for intranets, Document Management System (GED/ECM). It is even possible to create various kinds of applications based in content publishing as fundraising and e-commerce applications. Quokka is Open Source developed in Python using Flask and MongoDB as its base. Quokka is not limited to CMS area, it is possible to create Quokka extensions to provide any kind of web application based on Python and Flask. Optionally, Quokka can generate a static website from the contents generated in its admin interface. Features Web based content management admin interface Multiple content formats (markdown, rst, html, plaintext) Compatibility with any of the Pelican Themes Flat file NoSQL database TinyDB or optionally MongoDB for scale deployments Host the Quokka on server or generate a static website Extensible via modules/plugins Powered by Python, Flask, Flask-Admin, TinyMongo and Pelican Themes Installation Demo Use this if you want to see how Quokka works (you need to have docker installen in your machine) docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 quokka/quokka Go to http://localhost:5000/admin and login using admin/admin. Installing Quokka from Pypi NOTE: QuokkaCMS requires Python 3.6+ python3 -m venv venv . venv/bin/activate pip3 install quokka Installing and running for development mode NOTE: Quokka CMS requires Python 3.6+ git clone https://github.com/quokkaproject/quokka cd quokka python3 -m venv venv . venv/bin/activate make install make devserver Using Quokka CMS Start a project quokka init NewWebsite --theme=flex --modules=gitpages,heroku \ud83d\udc39 Quokka project created \ud83d\udc39 \ud83d\udcdd Name: NewWebsite \ud83d\udcc1 Location: /tmp/newwebsite \ud83d\udcda Template: default \ud83c\udfa8 Themes: flex theme installed \ud83d\ude9a Modules: [gitpages, heroku] installed \ud83d\udd27 Config: Config file written in /tmp/newwebsite/quokka.yml \u27a1 Go to /tmp/newwebsite \u2699 run `quokka runserver` to start! \ud83d\udcc4 Check the documentation on http://quokkaproject.org \ud83d\udc39 Happy Quokka! \ud83d\udc39 YES! it outputs emojis \ud83d\udc39 The above command will generate your project in NewWebsite folder as: . \u251c\u2500\u2500 databases # TinyDB database files (gitignored) \u251c\u2500\u2500 modules # Custom modules to load on EXTRA_EXTENSIONS \u251c\u2500\u2500 static_build # output static site \u251c\u2500\u2500 themes # Front-end Themes (Pelican and Quokka Themes supported) \u251c\u2500\u2500 uploads # Media uploaded via admin \u251c\u2500\u2500 .gitignore # gitignore to exclude sensitive files \u251c\u2500\u2500 quokka.yml # Project settings \u251c\u2500\u2500 .secrets.yml # To store keys, tokens and passwords (gitignored) \u2514\u2500\u2500 wsgi.py # To deploy `gunicorn wsgi:app` You can optionally pass arguments: Choose existing theme (the default is Malt ) quokka init NewWebsite --theme http://github.com/<user>/theme Install modules quokka init NewWebsite --theme http://github.com/<user>/theme --modules=\"commerce,foo\" the above looks for quokka_commerce and quokka_foo in PyPI and installs it Set important configurations quokka init NewWebsite --theme http://github.com/user/theme --config=\"auth_enabled=false\" That is optional, you can to edit quokka.yml to tune your settings. Create an admin user quokka adduser Run your website quokka runserver --port 5000 Access admin interface http://localhost:5000/admin Access your site http://localhost:5000 Deploy You can deploy your Quokka Website in a WSGI server Check the wsgi.py and refer to it when deploying in wsgi servers. cd myproject gunicorn wsgi:app -w 4 -b \"0.0.0.0:8000\" An example of supervisord config [program:quokka] command=/myproject/venv/bin/gunicorn wsgi:app -w 4 -b \"0.0.0.0:8000\" directory=/myproject For more information read Gunicorn documentation Publish Static HTML website NOTE : To generate a static website all user management, keys and passwords will be removed from settings. You can generate a static HTML website to host anywhere Once you have your website running locally you can easily generate a static HTML website from it. $ quokka publish --static [--output path] Generating static HTML website on ./static_build folder Once you have a ./static_build folder populated with static website you can deploy it using SCP, FTP or git, it is a full static website. Deploying to github pages from command line NOTE: You need either ssh key access to github or it will ask login/password quokka publish --static --git=<user>/<mysite> --branch=gh_pages The above is also available in admin under 'publish' menu. Deploying via SCP $ quokka publish --static --scp --dest='me@hostname:/var/www/mysite' [--sshkey ~/.ssh/key] [--password xyz] password: ... Deploying to Heroku This requires heroku client installed, if Procfile is not found it will be generated quokka publish --static --heroku --options Deploying via FTP quokka publish --static --ftp --host='ftp://server.com' --dest='/var/www/mysite' Load database from remote deployment (only for TinyDB) When you publish a static website along with the static files the database also goes to the server under the databases/ folder only as a backup and snapshot. You can load that remote database locally e.g: to add new posts and then re-publish $ quokka restoredb --remote --git=rochacbruno/mysite Creating a backup of local database... Downloading remote database Restoring database.. Done... Now you can run quokka runserver open your localhost:5000/admin write new content and then Publish website again using command line or admin interface. NOTE: If you want to restore a local database use --local and --path path/to/db Using MongoDB You can choose to use MongoDB instead of TinyDB, That is useful specially if you deploy or local instance has more than one admin user concurrently and also useful if you want to install plugins which support MongoDB only (because it relies on aggregations and gridfs) You only need a running instance of Mongo server and change quokka.yml:DB on your project from: quokka: DB: system: tinydb folder: databases to: quokka: DB: system: mongodb name: my_database host: 127.0.0.1 port: 2600 Then when running quokka again it will try to connect to that Mongo Server. With that you can deploy your site on wsgi server or can also generate static website. Running mongo in a Docker container cd <your quokka project folder> docker run -d -v $PWD/databases:/data/db -p 27017:27017 mongo # wait some seconds until mongo is started quokka runserver Contributing to Quokka CMS Development Do you want to be part of this open-source project?
